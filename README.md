**Solve Me First**

Complete the function solveMeFirst to compute the sum of two integers.

Function prototype:

int solveMeFirst(int a, int b);

where,

a is the first integer input.
b is the second integer input
Return values

sum of the above two integers

**Grading Students**

HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example, grade = 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.

 

Function Description

Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below. It should return an integer array consisting of rounded grades.

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

grades: an array of integers representing grades before rounding
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, the number of students.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[ i  ], denoting student 's i grade.

 

Constraints

1 <= n <= 60
0 <= grades [ i  ] <= 100
Output Format

For each grades [ i  ], print the rounded grade on a new line.

 

Sample Input 0

4

73

67

38

33

 

Sample Output 0

75

67

40

33

 

Explanation 0


Student 1 received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 75. Since 75 - 73 < 3, the student's grade is rounded to 75.
Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70. Since 70 - 67  = 3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.
Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40 - 38 < 3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.
Student 4 received a grade below 38, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33.



**Sock Merchant**

John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

For example, there are  socks with colors . There is one pair of color  and one of color . There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is .

Function Description

Complete the sockMerchant function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of matching pairs of socks that are available.

sockMerchant has the following parameter(s):

n: the number of socks in the pile
ar: the colors of each sock
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of socks represented in .
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the colors  of the socks in the pile.

**Counting Valleys**

Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly n steps.

For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill, D step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude.

We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.

For example, if Gary's path is s = [DDUUUUDD], he first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then he climbs out an up onto a mountain 2 units high. Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.

Challenge: Print a single integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary walked through during his hike.
